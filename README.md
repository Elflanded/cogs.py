# cogs.py

This is a repository for discord.py beginners, this will help you understand how cogs work, how to use them, and hopefully teach you how to create you first command!


# Instructions

To setup the repository, go to `.env.example`, and enter your bot's information, then rename it from `.env.example`, to `.env`.

  An example of a complete `.env`
  ```
  DISCORD_TOKEN=thIs-1IsnOt-A-rEal-toKn
  DISCORD_PREFIX=!
  DEVELOPERS=738604939957239930
  ```
  
  ### How .env works.
  
  .env is a secret folder that is used to hide project crednitnals, we will use this to hide our bot token, IDs, and prefixes.
  


Once you're run, open up your console, then run `python main.py`.
